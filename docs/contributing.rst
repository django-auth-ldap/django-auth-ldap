Contributing
============

If you'd like to contribute, the best approach is to send a well-formed pull
request, complete with tests and documentation. Pull requests should be
focused: trying to do more than one thing in a single request will make it more
difficult to process.

If you have a bug or feature request you can try `logging an issue`_.

There's no harm in creating an issue and then submitting a pull request to
resolve it. This can be a good way to start a conversation and can serve as an
anchor point.

Development
-----------

To get set up for development, activate your virtualenv and use pip to install
from ``dev-requirements.txt``:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

To run the tests:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ django-admin test --settings tests.settings

To run the full test suite in a range of environments, run `tox`_ from the root
of the project:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ tox

This includes some static analysis to detect potential runtime errors and style
issues.
