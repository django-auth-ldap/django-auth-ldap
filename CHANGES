v1.1.3 - 2013-01-05
-------------------

* Fix #33: Reject empty passwords by default.
  
  Unless AUTH_LDAP_PERMIT_EMPTY_PASSWORD is set to True,
  LDAPBackend.authenticate() will immediately return None if the password is
  empty. This is technically backwards-incompatible, but it's a more secure
  default for those LDAP servers that are configured such that binds without
  passwords always succeed.

* Fix #39: Add support for pickling LDAP-authenticated users.
